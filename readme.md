## 📂 Structure  

The repository is organized as follows:  

```
advent-of-code/  
│
├── 2024/  
│   ├── 1/
│       ├── input       # Your puzzle input for Day 1  
│       └── index.js    # Solution for Day 1 with several comments
│   ├── ...
│  
└── README.md          # This file  
```  

Each day has its folder containing:  
- `input`: The input data for the puzzle.  
- `index.js`: My implementation of the solution, with comments for explaining each steps.
