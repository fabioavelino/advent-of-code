# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This repo contains my solutions to the coding challenges presented daily during the Advent of Code event in December.  

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th, featuring fun and tricky problems designed to enhance your coding and problem-solving skills.  

## 🛠️ Setup  

To run the solutions locally, you'll need:  
- **[Node.js 22.9.0 or upper](https://nodejs.org/en)**

### Steps:  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabioavelino/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code
   ``` 
2. Run a puzzle solution (for example, for 2024, the Day 1):  
   ```bash
   cd 2024/1  # Example for 2024, Day 1
   node index.js # The console will return part one and part two response
   ```  
   ⚠️ You will need to copy your input data in each puzzle folder and named it `input` in order to run the solution ⚠️.

## 📂 Structure  

The repository is organized as follows:  

```
advent-of-code/  
│
├── 2024/  
│   ├── 1/
│       ├── input       # Your puzzle input for Day 1  
│       └── index.js    # Solution for Day 1 with several comments
│   ├── ...
│  
└── README.md          # This file  
```  

Each day has its folder containing:  
- `input`: The input data for the puzzle, never present in this repo.  
- `index.js`: My implementation of the solution, with comments for explaining each steps.
